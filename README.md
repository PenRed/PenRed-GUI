# PenRed-GUI
Graphical User Interface for PenRed simulation configuration

The PenRed-GUI program enables the construction of configuration files through a graphical user interface. However, we are currently in the process of developing the initial version of the program. Although it is already functional, at present, only precompiled versions are accessible, and these can be located on the 'Releases' page. The source code itself is not yet available.

You can access the relevant user guide documentation for the program within this repository.
